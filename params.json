{"name":"Jsnum","body":"JSNum: JavaScript Numerics\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThis is a library designed to provide basic numerical algorithms for\r\nJavaScript.  While still early in the project, basic support for\r\nmultidimensional arrays and core matrix operations are working\r\n(e.g. matrix inversion, LU decomposition, and solving linear systems\r\nof equations).\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n```javascript\r\nXvar A = jsnum.asNDArray([1, 3], [4, 5]),\r\n    B = jsnum.asNDArray([4, 5]);\r\n\r\nA.dot(B);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nReleased under a BSD license\r\n","tagline":"JavaScript Numerics","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
