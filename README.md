JSNum: JavaScript Numerics
========================

This is a library designed to provide basic numerical algorithms for
JavaScript.  While still early in the project, basic support for
multidimensional arrays and core matrix operations are working
(e.g. matrix inversion, LU decomposition, and solving linear systems
of equations).

Documentation for the library can be found at http://kms15.github.com/jsnum/ .
